This is a jsReactive project
Finally, letâ€™s get reactive:
1. Create a folder called JsReactive, connect to Git/GitHub
2. Add an index.html & app.js file, link them together
3. Configure your debugger
4. Add in at least 3 content tags each with a unique id
5. Use a DOM selector to grab 1 tag from the page based on id
6. Attach an event listener to that element that will react to a click.
1. Change the element background color to orange when this occurs
7. Use a DOM selector to grab another tag from the page based on id
8. Attach an event listener to that element that will react to a double
click (event called `dblclick`)
1. Change the element to be a new tag using outerHTML when this occurs
9. Use a DOM selector to grab the final tag from the page based on 
id
10. Attach an event listener to that element that will react to a hover
(event called `mouseover`)
1. Write a loop that will add 3 p tags before this element
